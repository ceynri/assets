# Image Hosting Repository

Here is the repository I used to store the images used on github. Nothing interesting.

You can also build such a repo and use some tools to make image upload easily.

These images are mainly uploaded through the [plugin](https://github.com/xiaou66/utools-pictureBed) of [utools](https://u.tools/).

> Tips: use <https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/:user-name/:repo-name/:img-path> can load images faster in China.
